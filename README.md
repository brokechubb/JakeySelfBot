# Jakey 🤖

The chaotically brilliant Discord assistant that fuses enterprise-grade engineering with the razor-sharp wit of a Vegas pit boss who just blew his life savings on a hard eight. This isn’t your average chat bot—it’s a full-stack powerhouse capable of tracking your crypto portfolio down to the last satoshi, scouring the web for answers, and recalling your favorite color while roasting your life decisions with surgical precision. Built on AI and a grandma-offending attitude, Jakey is a sysadmin-approved package that somehow works.

## 📖 A Loopy Language Model 📖

Holy shit, this project is my baby - a wild ride through full-stack development that somehow ended up being a production-ready Discord bot. I started this as experiment with my Discord community and ended up building something that could probably run a small business. Here's what makes Jakey tick:

### 🏗️ **The Tech Stack That Could**

- **Microservices Madness**: MCP memory server with HTTP APIs and fancy port magic
- **Async Everything**: Because waiting is for losers - full async/await with aiohttp and aiosqlite
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean architecture that doesn't suck (most of the time)
- **Resilience Engineering**: Shit breaks? No problem - automatic failover and recovery

### 🤖 **AI That Actually Works**

- **Free AI Models**: Pollinations primary, OpenRouter backup - never gets stuck
- **Art Gallery in Your Discord**: 49 artistic styles from Van Gogh to anime waifus
- **Tool Belt**: 12 specialized tools for crypto prices, web search, math, and more
- **Anti-Repetition Tech**: Advanced system so Jakey doesn't repeat himself like a broken record

### 🛠️ **Full-Stack Chaos**

- **Backend**: Python async services, REST APIs, database wizardry
- **Frontend**: Discord interface with 35 commands that actually work
- **Database**: SQLite with async ops and proper data modeling
- **APIs**: Integrated with CoinMarketCap, SearXNG, tip.cc, and more

### 🧪 **Testing That Actually Happens**

- **81 Unit Tests**: Yeah, I actually wrote tests and they all pass
- **Integration Tests**: Makes sure all the APIs talk to each other nicely
- **MCP Memory Tests**: 10 tests just for the memory system
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures because crashes are embarrassing

### 🚀 **DevOps That Scales**

- **Multi-Platform**: Systemd, PM2, Docker - deploy anywhere
- **Config Management**: 70+ settings because customization is key
- **Self-Hosted Infra**: SearXNG search, MCP memory server
- **Production Hardening**: Rate limiting, security, backups

### 🎰 **The Fun Stuff**

- **Crypto Tipping**: tip.cc integration with balance tracking
- **Airdrop Automation**: Smart claiming system with retry logic
- **Gambling Tools**: Keno generator, bonus schedules, financial calcs
- **Memory System**: Remembers your shit so conversations make sense

**Bottom line**: This started as a learning project and became a beast. Jakey proves you can build enterprise-level shit while keeping it fun and degenerate. Everything is rigged, but at least the code works! 🎰💩

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### 🤖 AI Model & Content

- **Uncensored AI**: Jakey uses uncensored AI models that can generate explicit, offensive, or controversial content
- **No Content Filtering**: Unlike mainstream AI services, Jakey has minimal content restrictions
- **User Responsibility**: All generated content is the responsibility of the user - use discretion
- **Degenerate Personality**: Jake's responses reflect his cynical, gambling-obsessed persona

### 🚨 Self-Bot Risks & Legal Notice

**Self-botting violates Discord's Terms of Service and can result in account suspension or permanent bans.**

- **Account Risks**: Using self-bots can lead to Discord account termination
- **Legal Gray Area**: Self-botting exists in a legal gray area and is not officially supported
- **Educational Use Only**: This project is for educational and personal use only
- **No Warranty**: Use at your own risk - the developers are not responsible for account issues
- **Rate Limiting**: Discord actively detects and blocks self-bot behavior
- **API Changes**: Discord frequently updates their API, potentially breaking self-bot functionality

**Bottom line**: Self-botting is risky business. Use Jakey responsibly and be prepared for potential consequences. Everything is rigged, but at least you were warned! ⚠️🚫
